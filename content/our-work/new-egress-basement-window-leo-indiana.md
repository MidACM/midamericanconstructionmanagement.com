<h1 class="h2 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">Egress Basement Window in Leo, IN</h1>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">This customer already had a finished basement. But one of the rooms lacked any sort of windows, so it felt like a dungeon. They wanted to turn it into another bedroom, but without any egress it was unsafe for sleeping in. </p>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">Our solution was to install a double window. This required excavating the site, installing a drain system, and building retaining walls. Of course we had to cut the concrete wall, and trim out both the interior and exterior for a finished look.</p>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">When we were finished, they ended up with a room that felt bright and open, was safe to use as a bedroom, and looked like an original feature of their home instead of an after the fact addition!</p>
