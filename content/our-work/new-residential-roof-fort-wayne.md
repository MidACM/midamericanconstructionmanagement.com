<h1 class="h2 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">New Residential Roof in Fort Wayne</h1>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">This residential client in the Fort Wayne area contacted us because they noticed that the granules were starting to come off of the shingles on their roof. Upon inspection we discovered signs of hail damage. As a result, we were able to get their insurance claim approved, and the client got an entire new roof for just the cost of their deductible!</p>
