</h1>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">
This client wanted to get their home ready to sell, but their windows were drafty, the gas had leaked out, and were generally dragging down the value of their home. </p>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">
Prior to talking to us, they had received a quote for vinyl replacement windows, but were concerned that these were not going to give them the market appeal they were hoping for.
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">
We were able to help them out with all new energy efficient new construction quality wood windows and patio door, that not only still fit their budget but were easily twice as nice as the low end vinyl replacement windows they would have gotten from the "other guys!" </p>
