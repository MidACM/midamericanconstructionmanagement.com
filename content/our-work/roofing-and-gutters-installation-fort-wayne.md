<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">This client in Fort Wayne, IN had hail damage on their roof so badly that their roof actually started leaking! We replaced the shingles, and while we were at it ripped up the water damaged OSB and replaced the ruined insulation from the outside so we didn&rsquo;t have to take down their drywall. They got an all new roof, new gutters and gutter guards, and their water damaged ceilings spot repaired. And yes, insurance paid for all of it except the deductible!</p>
