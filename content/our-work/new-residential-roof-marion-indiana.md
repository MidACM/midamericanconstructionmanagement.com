<h1 class="h2 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">New Residential Roof in Marion</h1>
<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">This residential client in the Marion area had an old farm house with four layers of shingles! The newest layer was 27 years old. We recommended a complete tear off, repair of any rotten decking, and all new lifetime warranty shingles. The result? A beautiful new and secure roof.</p>
