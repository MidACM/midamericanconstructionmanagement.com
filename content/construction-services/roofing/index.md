<h1 class="h2 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">Roofing Construction</h1>

<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">If you’re like most homeowners, you probably don’t give the roof of your home much thought from day to day. It just sort of sits up there, keeping the rain and snow out of your house. 
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">Maybe you notice over time some stains or streaks appearing. But it changes so slowly, and really, you have more immediate concerns. So you don’t really pay much attention.
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">And that is normally the way it should be. Your roof should give you years or even decades of worry free protection from the elements. But in the back of your mind you know, eventually something will have to be done with it. The only question is when.
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">Because of this, there are two errors homeowners most frequently make. One is to wait too long to replace your roof. Once leaks become visible, chances are you’ve actually had small leaks for years and will have damaged your house structure and end up spending much more than you would have had to when you finally replace it. 
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">But the other is getting scammed by unscrupulous contractors who come through and convince people that they need a new roof years before they actually do. This is all too pervasive in the industry. And the solution is to empower you, the homeowner, to be able to assess for yourself when your roof really needs replaced. 
</p>
<h2 class="h3 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">What to look for in roofs?</h2>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">First, a common misperception. Remember those stains and streaks we talked about earlier? While these can be unsightly, this typically by itself does not mean that your shingles have failed. There are chemical washes that can be used to clean these off your roof, both to improve the appearance and extend the life of your shingles. But do not allow a contractor to talk you in to replacing your shingles just because of these stains or streaks.

<h3 class="h4 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">Do I Need A New Roof?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Frequent blow-offs. Even a brand new roof can lose a shingle or two in a very bad storm and need to be repaired. However, if you find yourself losing shingles and needing to repair your roof after every moderate storm, it is almost certain that your entire roof should be replaced. 
</li>
  <li>Cracked shingles. This failure is hard to see from the ground, but will be quite visible from a ladder. If you can see a spiderweb of hairline cracks in the face of your shingles visible from two feet away, they are very near the end of their useful life and should be replaced within the next six to twelve months.
</li>
  <li>Curled shingle edges. Your shingles should lie flat on your roof. If the edges of your shingles are starting to curl up, it is time to start saving up to replace them. You may get another year or at the most two years of life out of them once this starts to appear. 
</li>
  <li>Lost granules. The gritty top coat of your shingles will shed lightly over time, especially the first year after installation. But when your shingles are failing at the end of their useful life they will begin to shed quickly. When you clean your gutters and find a thick build-up of shingle “grit” collected in the bottom, that is a sign that your roof only has a few years of life left. 
</li>
  <li>Hail damage. Hail damage is visible as small pits in the surface of your shingles. However, this can be difficult for someone unfamiliar with the roofing trades to spot. If you suspect your roof may have suffered hail damage, call out your insurance adjustor. Hail damage is almost always covered by your homeowner’s insurance. Never sign a contract with a roofer who contacts you after a hail storm until your insurance adjustor has signed off on the claim. 
</li>

<h3 class="h4 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">What to Do if I Have Storm Damage?
</h3>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">If a hailstorm or tornado or some other serious weather event has passed through your area, you have good reason to be concerned about your roof. Thankfully, if you have experienced roof damage from something like this, your homeowner’s insurance can help pay for part or even all of your damage. 
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">But watch out! There is a whole industry of “storm chasers” out there who do nothing but travel around the country looking to quickly profit off of hail and storm damage. 
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">And while some of them are legitimate businesses, many are outright scams who will take your money and disappear. And even the ones that are legit typically just make their money by bombarding you with ads, door knocking, and phone calls hoping to score a few high priced jobs and then just re-contract them out to local labor based on whoever gives them the lowest price. 
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">If you think your roof has been damaged by a storm (or you’re suddenly deluged with people contacting you about storm damage) do NOT sign a contract with anyone just on their say-so! Here is what you need to do to ensure that your home is properly taken care of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assess the damage. Make sure there are no visible holes in your roof. If you have any obvious holes or missing shingles, get them covered with a tarp asap.
</li>
  <li>Contact your insurance agent. Let them know you suspect storm damage and want them to send out an adjuster. 
</li>
  <li>Research LOCAL roofing companies and decide who you want to work with for your potential repair. Of course we would love to be your contractor of choice, but don’t take our word for it. <strong>Check out our reviews on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=MidAmerican+Construction+Management&rlz=1C1ASUM_enUS786US786&oq=MidAmerican+Construction+Management&aqs=chrome..69i57.6464j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x88160f5fddbfe1af:0xd81dda3265f58943,1,,,">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/midamericanconstructionmanagement/reviews/">Facebook</a>!</strong>
</li>
  <li>Ask the contractor you decide you want to do business with to meet with you and your adjuster to walk the roof together. An experienced contractor on site will increase the chances that your adjuster will not improperly turn down a claim that rightfully would be approved. 
</li>
  <li>Never agree to work with a contractor who offers to “eat” your deductible to get your job. First of all because this is technically considered insurance fraud. But also, contractors who do this make up for the loss of income by shortchanging you either on the quality of materials used or on the workmanship of the laborers on your job. It can be tempting to try to save that deductible, but in the long run you will be much happier with a professionally completed job with quality materials.
