<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">You love your home and wouldn’t dream of moving. It’s the perfect location, and besides you’ve made so many memories here. </p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">If only it had a sunroom, or a formal dining room, or maybe a finished basement or additional bedroom! Then it would be perfect. </p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">But maybe the thought of turning your beautiful home into a construction zone fills you with anxiety. Dust and dirt everywhere, and your home torn up for who knows how long. 
</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">Worse, doubtlessly you have heard horror stories about remodeling and remodeling contractors, projects half finished for months, prices changing inexplicably in the middle of the project, or even jobs that never get done at all. </p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">We hear you, we understand, and we’ve figured out how to make room additions and remodeling a better experience for our customers!</p>
<ul>
	<li>We are local to you, based here between Fort Wayne and Auburn. The owner and all the craftsmen who work on your project are your neighbors. You never have to deal with out of town or out of state managers trying to run a job long distance with random subcontractors.</li>
	<li>We know that your house is not just a construction zone, it is your family home. We clean up every day and ensure that nothing dangerous for your kids or pets is ever left lying around overnight. </li>
	<li>We don’t start before everything is in place and once we start, we stay on your job until it is finished. </li>
	<li>Because we are local we are familiar with all the building codes and know many of the inspectors by name. Your project will not be delayed because of unfamiliarity with permitting and inspection requirements. </li>
	<li>And for your financial peace of mind, when we give you a contract price, we guarantee that the price will not change unless you add something to the job. No surprise extras. Ever. 
</li>
</ul>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">So why wait? Give us a call at 260-438-8357 or Contact Us to get started today!</p>
